Discussing about the use cases of blockchain in banking
The first use case is KYC and Identity Verification
Imagine walking into a bank and getting your account verified in seconds—no paperwork, no repeated checks. Sounds futuristic isn't it? Well, blockchain makes it possible! KYC and Identity Verification on a decentralized ledger means once you're verified, you can access financial services anywhere without re-submitting documents.

Now, let’s talk about something we’ve all experienced—cross-border payments. Why does sending money abroad take days and come with hidden fees? Blockchain enables direct, peer-to-peer transfers, cutting delays and costs. DBS have already leveraged this with “DBS Remit,” offering same-day transfers with zero fees.

And here’s where it gets even more exciting—the next use case Smart Contracts. Imagine loans, transactions, and fund releases happening automatically, with no paperwork or middlemen. That’s exactly what DBS Token Services is doing, integrating smart contracts for secure and programmable financial transactions. 

A Quick question for everyone here—how many of you know what DBS has accomplished so far in the world of digital KYC?

DBS has developed Digital KYC solutions, including Aadhaar-based OTP verification, Video-Based Customer Identification, and DigiLocker authentication. This allows customers to complete KYC remotely, open accounts, and access financial services instantly without visiting a branch.
